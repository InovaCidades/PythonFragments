#This time we'll give the expected result, and you'll use some combination of boolean operators to achieve that result.

#Remember, the boolean operators are and, or, and not. Use each one at least once!

# Use boolean expressions as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me false!
bool_one = (1 != 1) and ("Mene" == "Fofo") 

# Make me true!
bool_two = 1 == 1

# Make me false!
bool_three = 1 != 1

# Make me true!
bool_four = 1 == 1

# Make me true!
bool_five = 1 == 1
