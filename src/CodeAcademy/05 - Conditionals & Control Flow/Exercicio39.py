#For each boolean value in the editor, write an expression that evaluates to that value.

#Remember, comparators are: ==, !=, >, >=, <, and <=.

#Use at least three different ones!

#Don't just use True and False! That's cheating!

# Create comparative statements as appropriate on the lines below!

# Make me true!
bool_one = 5 < 6

# Make me false!
bool_two = 5 <= 4

# Make me true!
bool_three = 5 != 4 

# Make me false!
bool_four = 6 <= 5

# Make me true!
bool_five = 6 > 5
